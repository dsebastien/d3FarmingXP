===========
Diablo 3 XP Stats calculator.

# Usage
Use the form to add XP runs information:
* paragon level at the beginning of the run
* paragon level at the end of the run
* the XP at the beginning of the run (5 digits max for quick input, the value will be *1000 in calculations)
  * example 1: you have 1.000.000 xp. You enter 1000
  * example 2: you have 500.000 xp. You enter 500
* the XP at the beginning of the run (same)
* the duration (in minutes) of the run
* * tip: use the stop watch just below the field. Start the stopwatch, go get your XP, and hit copy when you're done
The information about runs is kept in your local browser, not on the Web.

# Release notes
* 2.1
  * Added next 10/100/1000 stats. For example if you're level 75, you'll know about level 80, 100 & 1000 (depressing :))
* 2.0
  * Updated for Paragon 2.0

# Facts for programming geeks
* HTML5 & new APIs
  * new form elements
  * local storage for recording the runs
* CSS3 (rounded stuff, drop shadows alternating colors in the table)
* jQuery (all the nifty grifty stuff including animations & the stopwatch)
